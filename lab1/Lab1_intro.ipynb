    "The goal of this lab is to give you a taste of how we can use Jupyter notebooks to replicate some of the graphs from this week's lecture. Doing so requires using some techniques that you will learn later in the semester, so **do not worry if a lot of the code doesn't make sense yet!!** We are going to \"toss you in the deep end\" here, but with a good floatation device.\n",

    "In particular, we'll reproduce Figure 4 from [this paper](https://omargarciaponce.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cross_border_spillover.pdf). The goals of this figure is to see how the expiration of an assault weapons ban in 2004 in three states which border Mexico but **not** California affected gun-related crime in nearby Mexican Municipios. \n",

    "\n",
    "2) `year`: the year that the crimes occurred  \n",
