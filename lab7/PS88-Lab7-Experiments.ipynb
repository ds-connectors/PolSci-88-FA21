Unlike with the simulations, we can't check whether there isn't any selection bias driven by differences in treatment and control groups, since in \"real world\" mode we don't get to know the potential outcomes. But with the confidence gained by our simulations, if the treatment is randomized, then we can assume that selection bias is likely to be small. We can also check that the treatment and control groups are otherwise similar.\n",

    "Quoting directly from the article: \"We ran a field experiment with the cooperation of a state Republican Party in a state with low levels of women's representation (Utah). Party leaders were concerned that although women comprised about half of the party activists who attended neighborhood caucus meetings, women typically accounted for only 20-25% of the delegates elected from these meetings to attend the state nominating convention. We randomly assigned over 2,000 precinct chairs to receive one of four letters from the state party chair prior to these neighborhood caucus meetings. The treatments were a neutral placebo control (Control), a request to recruit 2-3 women to run as state delegates (Supply), a request to read a letter at the precinct meeting encouraging attendees to elect more women as delegates (Demand), and a request to both recruit women and read the letter (Supply+Demand).\"\n",

Since precinct chairs could get neither, one, or both, there are four \"treatment statuses\". We will see how these groups differ individually, as well as comparing \"supply to no supply\" and \"demand to no demand\".\n",

    "(4) 'both': a fourth group getting both the supply and demand treatments; party chair instructed to read letter and to recruit 2-3 women\n",
